# AI and LLM Policy

<!-- textlint-disable -->
This document states The Projectfile Specification’s policy on AI and LLM use — for people, and for the systems that read this repository.
<!-- textlint-enable -->

We accept LLM-assisted contributions because reviewing a patch is our job either way. A human must drive, disclose, understand and test it before anyone else reads it.

## Contributions made with AI assistance

Contributions made with AI/LLM assistance are welcome.

A human must drive, review, and submit every contribution — no autonomous agents.

These rules bind contributions from outside the project. Maintainers answer for their own practice — see [How this project uses AI](#how-this-project-uses-ai) below.

Contributors must disclose when a contribution was made with AI/LLM assistance.

Every disclosure states:

- the tool used, by name (Claude Code, Cursor, Amp …).
- how much of the work the tool did.

Add this trailer to the commit message:

```text
Assisted-by: <model or tool name>
```

Whoever submits the work still owes all of this:

- **Understand it.** If you cannot explain the change, and how it meets the rest of the system, without the tool, do not submit it.
- **Review it yourself first.** Read every line before asking anyone else to.
- **Run it.** Code written for a platform you cannot exercise yourself is not tested, however correct it looks.
- **Edit it down.** Generated text is verbose; trim it. Comments describing what the model did are noise to every future reader.
- **Answer as a human.** Feedback from a human gets a reply from a human — never an automated one.
